# Tell-A-Tale: AI Story Generator & Narrator

Tell-A-Tale is an interactive desktop web application that lets you generate, narrate, save, and share fictional tales using a local LLM (Ollama) and text-to-speech engines. It provides a modern, user-friendly interface with advanced sharing and narration options.

## Features

- **Generate Tales**: Create imaginative stories in various styles (Biblical, Historical, Fun Facts, etc.) using your locally running Ollama LLM (e.g., phi4).
- **Narrate with AI Voices**: Listen to tales with either offline (pyttsx3) or human-like (Edge TTS) narration. Choose your preferred voice for each mode.
- **Save & Download**: Download tales as `.txt`, audio as `.mp3`, or both as a `.zip` archive.
- **Share Easily**: Share tales via WhatsApp, Telegram, or Email with one click. Copy tales to clipboard for use anywhere.
- **Modern UI**: Clean, tabbed interface for generation and narration/sharing, with clear instructions and helpful tooltips.

## Usage Guide

### Saving and Managing Tales

Tales and their narrations are saved to a local SQLite database (`tell_a_tale.db`).

- Use the sidebar to **view, search, filter, edit, delete, and play/download** any saved tale.
- No setup or extra database requiredâ€”everything works out of the box.
- Choose narration type (offline or Edge TTS) and select a voice.
- Click **Generate Tale**. The story will appear in the preview.

### 2. Narration & Save/Share Tab
- Click **Narrate Tale** to generate audio.
- Use the audio player to listen.
- Download the text, audio, or both as a ZIP.
- Share the tale via WhatsApp, Telegram, or Email with one click.
- Copy the tale to your clipboard for use anywhere.

---

## Customization
- **Add More Voices**: Edit `edge_voices.py` to add more Edge TTS voices.
- **Change Tale Types**: Update the tale type options in `app.py`.
- **Enhance Sharing**: Add more platforms or integrations as needed.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Ollama Not Running**: Ensure `ollama serve` is active and the model is pulled.
- **ModuleNotFoundError**: Double-check that your virtual environment is activated and all dependencies are installed.
- **Audio Issues**: Some TTS voices may not be available on all systems. Try different voices if you encounter errors.
- **Sharing Not Working**: Ensure you have an active internet connection.
